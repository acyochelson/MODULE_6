            <h3>Sprout & Grow</h3>
            <p>
              The Sprout & Grow website was an assignment to design a website for a fake company named "Sprout and Grow". For this project I wrote all of the HTML and CSS and sourced all of the images other than the logo provided. The website consists of 7 webpages including index, shop, about, resources, customer inquiry, community forum, and blog pages.

            <h3>London International Website</h3>
            <p>
              The London International Website was an assignment for my Junior year EComm class in high school to design a website to help people plan a trip for a city abroad. I chose London as my city and included information on the site such as hotels to book, transportation options, places to visit, and more. I also included an FAQ page and an interactive photo gallery.

            <h3>The Knitting Corner</h3>
            <p>
              The Knitting Corner was my capstone project for my Junior year EComm class in high school. The assignment was to make a fake E-Commerce website, and I chose to make mine for selling knitting and crochet supplies. The site contains several pages including a "Catalog" page that can be used to navigate all of the products on the site, and product-description pages with drop-down lists for selecting quantity and type.
