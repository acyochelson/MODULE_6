		<div class="charitybody"><img src="sclub.jpg" alt="Sierra Club" height="300px"/></div>
		<div class="paragraph" id="charitybody">As a company, we believe we need to help give back in any way we can. We've chosen to support the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/" target="_blank">Sierra Club</a> because they support finding and funding solutions to many environmental issues such as reducing fossil fuel dependence and preserving wildlife, while also promoting new jobs with their work. They were originally started in 1892 by John Muir to campaign against the reduction of Yosemite National Park, and have stood by their values to this day.</br></br>
