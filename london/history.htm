	<h2>London History</h2>
	<div style="float: right; margin: 10px"><img src="images/bridge1.jpg" alt="Bridge 1" height="150px"/></div>
	<p>For nearly 2000 years there has been a “London Bridge” over River Thames. The first one was built in 43 A.D. by the Romans with planks laid across boats. The next record of the bridge is in 984 when a woman who was thought to be a witch was drowned off what’s said to be a wooden version of the bridge. By 1014 the Danes had control of London and Vikings from Norway came to divide them. To do this they tied their boats to the bridge’s supports and rowed as fast as they could, pulling down the bridge.</p></br>

	<p>Finally, in 1176, the first stone version of the London Bridge was built. This was the most successful bridge out of all the previous attempts and although it took 33 years to build, it lasted for over 600 years and had many benefits for the city. This bridge had many important features such as a drawbridge to keep out unwanted boats and water wheels which were used to pump water into the city by 1580.</p></br>

	<p>After hundreds of years, this bridge was damaged from time and weather and it was decided that it needed to be taken down for a new bridge to be built. This bridge was built by 1831 and made of granite. One of the obstacles found with the bridge’s construction was that the old bridge was only built for horse drawn carriages and needed to be updated to be sturdier. Even with a few problems along the way, the New London Bridge completed construction in 6 years, significantly faster than the previous version.</p></br>

	<p>When traffic began increasing in 1962, the London Bridge began sinking into the river and needed to be rebuilt. In order to maintain this traffic during the construction of the new bridge, they decided to both build the new bridge and take down the old bridge at the same time. Although this added to the construction time, travel was not restricted on the bridge for a single day. The bridge was completed by 1973 and is the bridge that is still in use today.</p>
